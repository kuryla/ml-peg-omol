ACONFL Benchmark (Alkane Conformers)

- Contains conformer energies from the ACONFâ€‘L set; local results are under `data/results_aconfl`.
- To fully integrate, a calc module can read geometries and compute relative conformer energies per molecule, comparing against reference values from the SI spreadsheet (jp2c02439_si_001.xlsx).
- Added now: data/README and bootstrap space for results ingestion.
