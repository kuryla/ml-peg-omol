2. Install `mlip-testing` with dependencies in a virtual environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ddmms/mlip-testing
cd mlip-testing
uv sync # Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install  # Install pre-commit hooks
pytest -v  # Discover and run all tests
```

Please refer to the [online documentation](https://ddmms.github.io/mlip-testing/developer_guide/index.html)
for information about contributing new benchmarks and models.
